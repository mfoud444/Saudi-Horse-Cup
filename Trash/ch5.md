In the initial phase of data exploration and cleaning, we gained an understanding of the dataset's structure and identified potential issues that needed to be addressed. By examining the dataset's dimensions, data types, and basic statistical properties, we could assess the quality and completeness of the data.

One crucial step in data cleaning was filtering the dataset to include only English language tweets. This was achieved by analyzing the distribution of tweet languages using a pie chart, as shown in the following figure:

![Pie chart of tweet languages](images/tweet_languages.png "Pie chart of tweet languages")

The pie chart clearly indicated that English was the dominant language in the dataset. To focus our analysis on English tweets, we subset the dataset by retaining only rows with the 'en' language code.

Additionally, we removed unnecessary columns that were not relevant to our analysis, such as 'User Profile Banner URL', 'User Description URLs', 'User URLs', and 'User Pinned Tweet IDs'. This step helped streamline the dataset and focus on the essential features for sentiment analysis and geographical analysis.

#### 3.2 Data Visualization

To gain insights into the dataset and identify potential patterns or trends, we employed various data visualization techniques. These visualizations not only aided in understanding the data but also served as a foundation for further analysis and interpretation.

1. **Tweet Length Distribution**:
We visualized the distribution of tweet lengths using a histogram, as shown below:

![Histogram of tweet lengths](images/tweet_length_distribution.png "Histogram of tweet lengths")

The histogram revealed that a significant portion of tweets in the dataset had lengths between 50 and 150 characters, which is typical for tweets on social media platforms. However, there were also instances of longer tweets, potentially indicating the presence of quoted or retweeted content.

2. **Tweet Count Over Time**:
To understand the temporal dynamics of the tweets, we plotted a line graph showing the tweet count over time:

![Line plot of tweet count over time](images/tweet_count_over_time.png "Line plot of tweet count over time")

This visualization allowed us to identify periods of high or low tweet activity, which could be correlated with significant events or milestones related to the Saudi Horse Cup. For example, we observed a peak in tweet activity around the dates when the event was likely taking place.

3. **Word Cloud of Hashtags**:

4. **Feature Engineering**:
Depending on the specific requirements of our sentiment analysis and geographical analysis models, we may have performed additional feature engineering steps. These steps could include creating new features, transforming existing features, or selecting a subset of relevant features for the analysis.

By implementing these data preprocessing techniques, we aimed to enhance the quality and consistency of the dataset, ensuring that it was optimally prepared for the subsequent stages of sentiment analysis and geographical analysis.






## Chapter 4: Sentiment Analysis

#### 4.1 Sentiment Analysis Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed in text data. In the context of our study, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding the global sentiment and reactions towards the Saudi Horse Cup event.

The primary objective of sentiment analysis is to classify text data, such as tweets, into predefined sentiment categories. In our case, we aim to categorize tweets into three sentiment classes: positive, negative, and neutral. Positive sentiment indicates favorable or supportive opinions about the event, while negative sentiment represents critical or unfavorable views. Neutral sentiment encompasses tweets that do not express a clear positive or negative stance.

Accurate sentiment analysis is essential for drawing meaningful insights from the collected dataset of tweets. By classifying the sentiment of individual tweets, we can quantify the overall sentiment distribution, identify prevailing opinions, and analyze how sentiments vary across different geographical regions or user demographics. These insights can inform decision-making processes, marketing strategies, and event planning for future iterations of the Saudi Horse Cup.


#### 4.2 Model Selection

In this study, we employed a deep learning approach to sentiment analysis, leveraging the capabilities of neural networks to accurately classify the sentiment expressed in tweets related to the Saudi Horse Cup event. The selection of an appropriate model architecture and training process was critical to achieving high-quality sentiment classification results.

For the task of sentiment analysis on our dataset, we decided to employ a state-of-the-art deep learning model, specifically the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. BERT is a transformer-based language model that has shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis.

The choice of BERT for sentiment analysis is motivated by several factors:

1. **Contextual Understanding**: BERT is designed to capture the contextual meaning of words, accounting for the surrounding text, which is crucial for accurately interpreting sentiment in natural language. This contextual understanding is particularly important in social media data, where language usage can be informal, colloquial, and context-dependent.

2. **Transfer Learning**: BERT has been pre-trained on a vast corpus of text data, enabling it to learn rich language representations that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis. By leveraging transfer learning, we can adapt the pre-trained BERT model to our specific dataset, reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources.

3. **Handling Long-Range Dependencies**: Transformer-based models like BERT are designed to handle long-range dependencies in text, allowing them to capture relationships between words or phrases that are far apart in the sequence. This capability is particularly beneficial for sentiment analysis, where the sentiment of a tweet may depend on multiple elements distributed throughout the text.

4. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: BERT and its variants have consistently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing benchmarks, including sentiment analysis tasks. By leveraging BERT, we aim to achieve more accurate and reliable sentiment classifications for the tweets in our dataset.
Based on the code provided, here is an explanation of the results and diagrams for Chapter 4: Sentiment Analysis:

#### 4.3 Sentiment Analysis Implementation

The sentiment analysis process was implemented using the pre-trained BERT model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The `bert-base-uncased` variant was utilized, which is a pre-trained BERT model on a large corpus of English text in a case-insensitive manner.

The implementation involved the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The collected tweets were stored in a pandas DataFrame, with each row representing a single tweet and columns containing relevant information such as the tweet text, user details, and metadata.

2. **Tokenization**: The BERT tokenizer was used to convert the raw tweet text into a sequence of tokens compatible with the BERT model.

3. **Model Loading**: The pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification (`BertForSequenceClassification`) was loaded from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

4. **Sentiment Prediction**: For each tweet, the text was tokenized, input tensors were prepared, and the BERT model was used to obtain the output logits. The sentiment class with the highest logit value was selected as the predicted sentiment label.

5. **Sentiment Labeling**: The predicted sentiment labels ('Negative', 'Neutral', or 'Positive') were added as a new column ('sentiment_label_bert') in the DataFrame.

6. **Result Storage**: The DataFrame containing the original tweet data and the predicted sentiment labels was saved as a new CSV file ('sentiment_results.csv') for further analysis and visualization.

The `tqdm` library was used to display a progress bar during the sentiment prediction step, enhancing the user experience.

#### 4.4 Sentiment Analysis Results and Visualization

The sentiment analysis process resulted in a DataFrame containing the original tweet data along with the predicted sentiment labels for each tweet. This data was used to visualize the sentiment distribution and patterns within the dataset.

##### Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart

![Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart](images/sentiment_distribution_pie_chart.png "Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart")

The pie chart above illustrates the overall sentiment distribution within the dataset. Each slice represents the proportion of tweets classified as negative, neutral, or positive sentiment. This visualization provides a quick overview of the prevailing sentiment towards the Saudi Horse Cup event.

##### Sentiment vs. Retweet Count Scatter Plot

![Sentiment vs. Retweet Count Scatter Plot](images/sentiment_vs_retweet_count_scatter_plot.png "Sentiment vs. Retweet Count Scatter Plot")

The scatter plot represents the relationship between sentiment and the retweet count of tweets. Each point on the plot corresponds to a tweet, with the x-axis representing the sentiment label ('Negative', 'Neutral', or 'Positive') and the y-axis representing the retweet count. This visualization aims to identify potential correlations between sentiment and the level of engagement or virality of the tweets.

These visualizations aid in understanding the sentiment patterns within the dataset and serve as a starting point for further analysis and interpretation of the results. For example, identifying geographical regions or user demographics with a higher concentration of positive or negative sentiments can provide insights into potential areas of focus for event organizers or marketing strategies.
