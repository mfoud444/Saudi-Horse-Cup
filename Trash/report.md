In this  chapter, we have provided an overview of our study on analyzing global sentiment towards the Saudi Horse Cup using Twitter data. We have discussed the project's purpose, the significance of the Saudi Horse Cup, and the objectives and scope of the study. Additionally, we have highlighted the importance of this research in understanding public opinion, informing decision-making, and fostering international cooperation through equestrian sports.

Moving forward, the next chapter will focus on the data collection process. We will delve into the data sources, collection methods, Twitter API integration, sampling strategies, and ethical considerations involved in gathering a comprehensive dataset of tweets related to the Saudi Horse Cup. This chapter will lay the groundwork for the subsequent stages of data analysis and sentiment classification.




2.1 Data Sources

The primary data source for this study is the X (formerly Twitter) platform. X is a widely used social media platform that allows users to share short messages, known as tweets, with their followers and the public. The platform has a vast user base spanning various geographical regions, making it an ideal source for collecting global opinions and sentiments.

The data collected from X will consist of tweets related to the Saudi Horse Cup. These tweets will be identified using relevant keywords, hashtags, and mentions associated with the event. The specific keywords and hashtags will be determined based on a thorough analysis of the event's official promotions, media coverage, and user-generated content.

In addition to the text content of the tweets, we will also collect metadata associated with each tweet, such as the timestamp, user location (if available), language, and user profile information. This metadata will be crucial for conducting geographical analysis and understanding the demographics of the users expressing their opinions.

To ensure the comprehensiveness and reliability of the data, we will focus on collecting tweets from a specified time period surrounding the Saudi Horse Cup event. This time period will include the lead-up to the event, the event itself, and a suitable post-event period to capture the lingering sentiments and discussions.

2.2 Data Collection Methods

When it comes to collecting data from X (formerly Twitter), the official method is to use the X API through a developer account. The X API provides a structured and reliable way to access and retrieve data from the platform programmatically. However, using the official X API comes with certain limitations and costs. In our case, the high cost of $100 per month for API access poses a significant challenge, especially for a research project with limited resources.

To overcome this limitation, we have decided to explore an alternative approach using the Twikit library in Python. Twikit is an open-source library that provides a simple and efficient way to scrape tweets without the need for an API key. By leveraging Twikit, we can collect a substantial amount of tweet data related to the Saudi Horse Cup while avoiding the high costs associated with the official X API.

Justifications for using Twikit:

1. Cost-effective: Twikit allows us to collect tweet data without incurring the significant monthly costs associated with the official X API. This is particularly beneficial for research projects with limited budgets.

2. Simplified data collection: Twikit provides a straightforward and intuitive interface for scraping tweets. It abstracts away the complexities of authentication and API requests, making the data collection process more accessible and efficient.

3. Flexibility: Twikit offers flexibility in terms of the data we can collect. It allows us to search for tweets based on keywords, hashtags, and time periods, enabling us to gather relevant data specific to the Saudi Horse Cup event.

4. Community-driven: Twikit is an open-source library maintained by a community of developers. This means that it benefits from regular updates, bug fixes, and contributions from the community, ensuring its reliability and compatibility with the latest changes in the X platform.

To collect the required data using Twikit, we will follow these steps:

1. Installation: We will install the Twikit library in our Python environment using pip, the package installer for Python.

2. Search Functionality: Twikit provides a search functionality that allows us to retrieve tweets based on specific keywords, hashtags, and time periods. We will use this functionality to search for tweets containing relevant keywords and hashtags associated with the Saudi Horse Cup event.

3. Data Extraction: Once we have retrieved the relevant tweets using Twikit, we will extract the necessary information from each tweet, including the text content, timestamp, user details (if available), and any other relevant metadata. Twikit provides methods to access and extract this information from the retrieved tweets.

4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: After extracting the raw data from the tweets, we will perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset. This may involve removing duplicates, handling missing values, normalizing text, and applying text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, lowercase conversion, and removing special characters.

5. Data Storage: The cleaned and preprocessed data will be stored in a structured format, such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), for further analysis and processing. We will design an appropriate database schema to organize and store the data efficiently.

6. Data Backup and Security: To ensure data integrity and prevent loss, we will implement regular data backups and follow best practices for data security. This includes storing the data on secure servers, encrypting sensitive information, and restricting access to authorized personnel only.

By utilizing the Twikit library and following best practices for data collection, cleaning, and storage, we will gather a comprehensive dataset of tweets related to the Saudi Horse Cup. This dataset will serve as the foundation for the subsequent stages of data analysis, visualization, and sentiment classification.

It's important to note that while using Twikit provides a cost-effective and efficient alternative to the official X API, it may come with certain limitations, such as rate limits and the ability to retrieve historical data. However, for the purposes of our research project and given the financial constraints, Twikit presents a viable and practical solution for collecting the necessary tweet data.

Throughout the data collection process using Twikit, we will adhere to X's terms of service, developer guidelines, and any applicable legal and ethical considerations. We will also implement measures to handle data privacy and protect user anonymity, such as anonymizing user identities and handling personal information in compliance with relevant regulations.
