Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze global sentiment and reactions towards the Saudi Horse Cup by collecting and classifying Twitter comments. This will help in understanding the event’s impact, identifying prevailing opinions, and examining how these sentiments vary geographically. By training an AI model on this data, we aim to categorize the sentiments into negative, positive, or neutral, providing insights into public perception.

## Chapter 4: Sentiment Analysis

#### 4.1 Sentiment Analysis Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed in text data. In the context of our study, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding the global sentiment and reactions towards the Saudi Horse Cup event.

The primary objective of sentiment analysis is to classify text data, such as tweets, into predefined sentiment categories. In our case, we aim to categorize tweets into three sentiment classes: positive, negative, and neutral. Positive sentiment indicates favorable or supportive opinions about the event, while negative sentiment represents critical or unfavorable views. Neutral sentiment encompasses tweets that do not express a clear positive or negative stance.

Accurate sentiment analysis is essential for drawing meaningful insights from the collected dataset of tweets. By classifying the sentiment of individual tweets, we can quantify the overall sentiment distribution, identify prevailing opinions, and analyze how sentiments vary across different geographical regions or user demographics. These insights can inform decision-making processes, marketing strategies, and event planning for future iterations of the Saudi Horse Cup.


#### 4.2 Model Selection

In this study, we employed a deep learning approach to sentiment analysis, leveraging the capabilities of neural networks to accurately classify the sentiment expressed in tweets related to the Saudi Horse Cup event. The selection of an appropriate model architecture and training process was critical to achieving high-quality sentiment classification results.

For the task of sentiment analysis on our dataset, we decided to employ a state-of-the-art deep learning model, specifically the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. BERT is a transformer-based language model that has shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis.

The choice of BERT for sentiment analysis is motivated by several factors:

1. **Contextual Understanding**: BERT is designed to capture the contextual meaning of words, accounting for the surrounding text, which is crucial for accurately interpreting sentiment in natural language. This contextual understanding is particularly important in social media data, where language usage can be informal, colloquial, and context-dependent.

2. **Transfer Learning**: BERT has been pre-trained on a vast corpus of text data, enabling it to learn rich language representations that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis. By leveraging transfer learning, we can adapt the pre-trained BERT model to our specific dataset, reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources.

3. **Handling Long-Range Dependencies**: Transformer-based models like BERT are designed to handle long-range dependencies in text, allowing them to capture relationships between words or phrases that are far apart in the sequence. This capability is particularly beneficial for sentiment analysis, where the sentiment of a tweet may depend on multiple elements distributed throughout the text.

4. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: BERT and its variants have consistently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing benchmarks, including sentiment analysis tasks. By leveraging BERT, we aim to achieve more accurate and reliable sentiment classifications for the tweets in our dataset.
