# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze global sentiment and reactions towards the Saudi Horse Cup by collecting and classifying X (formerly Twitter) comments. The study will involve gathering a large dataset of tweets related to the event, preprocessing the data, and applying sentiment analysis techniques to categorize the tweets into positive or negative sentiment [1]. By examining the sentiment distribution and trends across different geographical regions, we seek to gain insights into the public perception and impact of the Saudi Horse Cup on a global scale. The project will leverage natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to automate the sentiment classification process [2]. Additionally, data visualization techniques will be employed to present the findings in an intuitive and informative manner. The ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the global sentiment surrounding the Saudi Horse Cup and identify any notable patterns or variations in opinions across different regions.

## 1.2 Saudi Horse Cup

The Saudi Horse Cup is a prestigious international equestrian event held annually in Saudi Arabia. It showcases the finest horses and riders from around the world, competing in various disciplines such as show jumping, dressage, and endurance racing [3]. The event attracts considerable attention from equestrian enthusiasts, media outlets, and the general public. As one of the most prominent equestrian competitions in the Middle East, the Saudi Horse Cup plays a significant role in promoting the sport and fostering international cooperation [4]. It provides a platform for athletes to showcase their skills and for countries to demonstrate their prowess in the equestrian field. The event also contributes to cultural exchange and tourism, drawing visitors from different parts of the world to witness the spectacular performances and experience the rich heritage of Saudi Arabia [5]. Given its international prominence and the growing interest in equestrian sports, analyzing the global sentiment towards the Saudi Horse Cup can provide valuable insights into how the event is perceived by people from diverse backgrounds and regions. Understanding public opinion can help organizers and stakeholders make informed decisions, improve the event experience, and enhance its overall impact on the equestrian community and beyond.

In this chapter, we have provided an overview of our study on analyzing global sentiment towards the Saudi Horse Cup using X (formerly Twitter) data. We have discussed the project's purpose, the significance of the Saudi Horse Cup, and the objectives and scope of the study. Additionally, we have highlighted the importance of this research in understanding public opinion, informing decision-making, and fostering international cooperation through equestrian sports. Moving forward, the next chapter will focus on the data collection process. We will delve into the data sources, collection methods, X (formerly Twitter) API integration, sampling strategies, and ethical considerations involved in gathering a comprehensive dataset of tweets related to the Saudi Horse Cup. This chapter will lay the groundwork for the subsequent stages of data analysis and sentiment classification.
