Here are the steps to implement the project analyzing global sentiment and reactions towards the Saudi Horse Cup:

1. Set up the development environment:
   - Install required Python libraries (transformers, evaluate, torch, snscrape, etc.)

2. Data collection:
   - Configure and set up Twitter API access
   - Implement asyncio-based Twitter scraping using twscrape
   - Collect tweets related to Saudi Horse Cup within a specific date range
   - Save collected data to a CSV file

3. Data preprocessing and visualization:
   - Load the collected data into a pandas DataFrame
   - Remove duplicate tweets
   - Filter tweets to keep only English language posts
   - Create visualizations:
     - Pie chart of tweet languages
     - Histogram of tweet lengths
     - Line plot of tweet count over time
     - Word cloud of hashtags
     - Bar plot of top countries by user count
     - Bar plot of top users by follower count

4. Sentiment analysis:
   - Download and prepare a pre-existing sentiment dataset
   - Implement a DataLoader class for importing and splitting tweet data
   - Create a TwitterSentimentClassifier class:
     - Initialize with a pre-trained model (e.g., Twitter/twhin-bert-base)
     - Implement tokenization and data preparation functions
     - Set up model training configuration
     - Train the sentiment analysis model
     - Implement model saving and loading functions
     - Create prediction and evaluation methods

5. Model training and evaluation:
   - Train the sentiment analysis model on the prepared dataset
   - Save the trained model locally
   - Evaluate the model on a test dataset
   - Calculate and report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

6. Sentiment prediction on Saudi Horse Cup tweets:
   - Load the trained model
   - Predict sentiment for the collected Saudi Horse Cup tweets
   - Add sentiment predictions to the dataset

7. Final analysis and visualization:
   - Create a pie chart of sentiment distribution for Saudi Horse Cup tweets
   - Save the final results with sentiment predictions to a CSV file

8. Optional: Package the trained model for future use or deployment

Key methodologies and important considerations:

- Use of asyncio for efficient Twitter data collection
- Leveraging pre-trained models (BERT) for sentiment analysis
- Proper data preprocessing and cleaning
- Visualization techniques for data exploration and result presentation
- Metrics calculation for model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)
- Batched prediction for efficient processing of large datasets
