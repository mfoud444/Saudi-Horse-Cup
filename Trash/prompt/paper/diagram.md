Sentiment prediction on Saudi Horse Cup tweets:
Key methodologies and important considerations:

- Use of twscrape for efficient Twitter data collection
- Leveraging pre-trained models (BERT) for sentiment analysis
- Proper data preprocessing and cleaning
- Visualization techniques for data exploration and result presentation
- Metrics calculation for model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)
- Batched prediction for efficient processing of large datasets
