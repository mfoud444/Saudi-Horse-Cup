I would like to request a rewrite of Chapter 3 with proper references. Specifically, I need the following:

- Compile a comprehensive list of all sources cited in the thesis, formatted according to IEEE guidelines. Ensure:
  - All in-text citations are included in the reference list.
  - No references are listed that were not cited in the text.
  - Correct and consistent formatting for each reference type (journal articles, books, websites, etc.).
  - References should be listed with numbers [21], [22], etc and started number from [21].
  - When writing the chapter, reference numbers should be included in the text like [21], [22].
  - The number of references must not exceed five
  - Put your final answer in the md file

Please ensure the highest level of accuracy and adherence to IEEE formatting standards.




## Chapter 3: Data Visualization and Preprocessing

### 3.1 Data Exploration and Cleaning

In the initial phase of data exploration and cleaning, we gained an understanding of the dataset's structure and identified potential issues that needed to be addressed. By examining the dataset's dimensions, data types, and basic statistical properties, we could assess the quality and completeness of the data.

One crucial step in data cleaning was filtering the dataset to include only English language tweets. This was achieved by analyzing the distribution of tweet languages using a pie chart, as shown in the following figure:

![Pie chart of tweet languages](images/tweet_languages.png "Pie chart of tweet languages")

The pie chart clearly indicated that English was the dominant language in the dataset. To focus our analysis on English tweets, we subset the dataset by retaining only rows with the 'en' language code.



### 3.2 Data Visualization

To gain insights into the dataset and identify potential patterns or trends, we employed various data visualization techniques. These visualizations not only aided in understanding the data but also served as a foundation for further analysis and interpretation.

1. **Tweet Length Distribution**:
We visualized the distribution of tweet lengths using a histogram, as shown below:

![Histogram of tweet lengths](images/tweet_length_distribution.png "Histogram of tweet lengths")

The histogram revealed that a significant portion of tweets in the dataset had lengths between 50 and 150 characters, which is typical for tweets on social media platforms. However, there were also instances of longer tweets, potentially indicating the presence of quoted or retweeted content.

2. **Tweet Count Over Time**:
To understand the temporal dynamics of the tweets, we plotted a line graph showing the tweet count over time:

![Line plot of tweet count over time](images/tweet_count_over_time.png "Line plot of tweet count over time")

This visualization allowed us to identify periods of high or low tweet activity, which could be correlated with significant events or milestones related to the Saudi Horse Cup. For example, we observed a peak in tweet activity around the dates when the event was likely taking place.

3. **Word Cloud of Hashtags**:
We generated a word cloud to visualize the most frequently used hashtags in the dataset:

The word cloud provided insights into the popular topics, themes, or keywords associated with the Saudi Horse Cup event. Hashtags like "#SaudiHorseCup" and "#SaudiArabia" were prominently visible, indicating their widespread use in the conversation.

4. **Top Countries by User Count**:
To gain insights into the geographical distribution of users contributing to the Saudi Horse Cup conversation, we created a horizontal bar plot showing the top 10 countries by user count:

![Horizontal bar plot of top 10 countries by user count](images/top_countries_user_count.png "Horizontal bar plot of top 10 countries by user count")

This visualization provided valuable information about the geographical regions with the highest user engagement in the conversation, which could be useful for targeted analysis or marketing efforts.

5. **Top Users by Follower Count**:
We also analyzed the influential users in the dataset by plotting a bar chart of the top 10 users with the highest follower counts:

![Bar plot of top 10 users by follower count](images/top_users_follower_count.png "Bar plot of top 10 users by follower count")

This analysis could potentially reveal the presence of influential voices or opinion leaders in the Saudi Horse Cup discourse, whose tweets may have a significant impact on public perception and sentiment.

These visualizations provided valuable insights into the dataset, enabling us to identify potential patterns, trends, and outliers. The findings from this data visualization phase informed our subsequent data preprocessing steps and guided the development of our sentiment analysis and geographical analysis approaches.

### 3.3 Data Preprocessing

Effective data preprocessing is crucial for achieving accurate and reliable results in any data analysis task. In this study, we performed several preprocessing steps to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset.

1. **Remove Dublicate row**:
Duplicate rows can skew the analysis by over-representing certain data points. To address this, we removed any duplicate rows from the dataset, ensuring that each record was unique and contributing to the overall analysis without redundancy.

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
We inspected the dataset for missing values and addressed them using appropriate techniques, such as imputation or removal, depending on the nature and extent of the missing data. Missing values can introduce bias and lead to inaccurate results, so it was essential to handle them appropriately.



By implementing these data preprocessing techniques, we aimed to enhance the quality and consistency of the dataset, ensuring that it was optimally prepared for the subsequent stages of sentiment analysis and geographical analysis.
