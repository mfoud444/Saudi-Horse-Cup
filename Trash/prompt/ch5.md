  - All in-text citations are included in the reference list.
  - No references are listed that were not cited in the text.
  - Correct and consistent formatting for each reference type (journal articles, books, websites, etc.).
  - References should be listed with numbers [38], [39], etc and started number from [38].
  - When writing the chapter, reference numbers should be included in the text like [38], [39].
  - The number of references must not exceed five
  - Put your final answer in the md file

Please ensure the highest level of accuracy and adherence to IEEE formatting standards.
