2. **Abstract**:

This study analyzes global sentiment towards the Saudi Cup, a prestigious international equestrian event, using social media data. Leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, particularly the BERT model, we conducted sentiment analysis on a large dataset of tweets collected using the Twikit library. The research aimed to understand public perception, identify sentiment patterns, and provide insights for event organizers and stakeholders.

 The study employed data visualization techniques to illustrate tweet activity, hashtag usage, and user demographics. Limitations of the research, including potential biases in social media data, were acknowledged.

This thesis contributes to the growing body of research on social media sentiment analysis in sports events and provides actionable insights for enhancing the Saudi Cup's global appeal. Future research directions, including multi-platform analysis and longitudinal studies, are proposed to further our understanding of public sentiment towards international equestrian events.


# 5. Introduction

## 5.1 Background

The Saudi Cup, established in 2020, has rapidly become one of the most prestigious and lucrative horse racing events in the world. With a prize purse of $20 million, it attracts top international horses, jockeys, and trainers, garnering significant global attention [1]. As social media continues to play a crucial role in shaping public opinion and engagement with sporting events, understanding the global sentiment towards the Saudi Cup becomes increasingly important for organizers, stakeholders, and the broader equestrian community.

## 5.2 Problem Statement

Despite the Saudi Cup's growing prominence, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of global public sentiment towards the event. This gap in understanding poses challenges for event organizers in terms of marketing strategies, stakeholder engagement, and overall event management. Additionally, the potential cultural and economic impact of the Saudi Cup on Saudi Arabia's international image and tourism industry remains largely unexplored through the lens of public sentiment.

## 5.3 Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are:

1. To analyze the global sentiment towards the Saudi Cup using social media data, specifically tweets related to the event.
2. To identify patterns and trends in public opinion across different geographical regions and user demographics.
3. To examine the relationship between sentiment and engagement metrics (e.g., retweets, likes) for Saudi Cup-related content.
4. To provide actionable insights for event organizers and stakeholders based on the sentiment analysis results.

## 5.4 Significance of the Study

This research contributes to the growing body of literature on social media sentiment analysis in the context of international sporting events. By focusing on the Saudi Cup, this study offers valuable insights into:

1. The global perception of a major Middle Eastern sporting event.
2. The effectiveness of the Saudi Cup's international outreach and marketing efforts.
3. Potential areas for improvement in event organization and public engagement.
4. The broader impact of the event on Saudi Arabia's efforts to diversify its economy and boost tourism through sports.

Moreover, the methodological approach employed in this study can serve as a template for analyzing public sentiment towards other major sporting events, providing a valuable tool for event organizers and researchers alike.

# 6. Literature Review

## 6.1 Social Media Sentiment Analysis in Sports

Social media sentiment analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding public opinion towards sporting events. Smith and Johnson (2022) demonstrated the effectiveness of Twitter data in predicting attendance and TV ratings for major soccer tournaments [2]. Similarly, Chen et al. (2023) used sentiment analysis to examine the impact of controversial decisions on fan engagement during the Olympics [3].

## 6.2 Cultural and Economic Impact of International Sporting Events

The hosting of major international sporting events can have significant cultural and economic implications for the host country. A study by Al-Rasheed (2021) explored the role of the Saudi Cup in Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plan, highlighting its potential to boost tourism and international relations [4]. Garcia and Lopez (2023) examined how social media sentiment towards the FIFA World Cup in Qatar influenced global perceptions of the country [5].

## 6.3 Machine Learning Approaches in Sentiment Analysis

Recent advancements in natural language processing have revolutionized sentiment analysis techniques. The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, introduced by Devlin et al. (2019), has shown remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis [6]. Zhang et al. (2022) demonstrated BERT's superiority over traditional machine learning methods in analyzing sentiment in sports-related tweets [7].

## 6.4 Challenges in Social Media Sentiment Analysis

While social media data offers rich insights, it also presents unique challenges. Moreno and Kim (2021) highlighted issues such as sarcasm detection, multi-lingual content, and bot activity in social media sentiment analysis [8]. Additionally, ethical considerations regarding privacy and consent in social media research were explored by Thompson et al. (2023) [9].

# 7. Methodology

## 7.1 Data Collection

### 7.1.1 Data Source
Data for this study was collected from Twitter (now Platform X) using the Twikit library, an open-source Python tool for scraping tweets. This approach was chosen due to its cost-effectiveness compared to the official Twitter API.

### 7.1.2 Sampling Strategy
Tweets were collected based on relevant keywords and hashtags related to the Saudi Cup, including but not limited to "Saudi Cup," "#SaudiCup," and "Saudi Horse Race." The data collection period spanned from [start date] to [end date], encompassing the lead-up to the event, the event itself, and a post-event period.

### 7.1.3 Ethical Considerations
To ensure ethical data handling, all collected tweets were anonymized, and personal identifiable information was removed. The study adhered to the platform's terms of service and relevant data protection regulations.

## 7.2 Data Preprocessing

### 7.2.1 Text Cleaning
Raw tweet text was preprocessed using the following steps:
1. Removal of URLs, special characters, and non-alphabetic characters
2. Conversion to lowercase
3. Tokenization
4. Removal of stop words
5. Lemmatization

### 7.2.2 Feature Extraction
Additional features were extracted from the tweets, including:
- Tweet length
- Presence of hashtags
- Number of mentions
- Retweet count
- Like count

## 7.3 Sentiment Analysis

### 7.3.1 Model Selection
The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model was selected for sentiment analysis due to its state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing tasks.

### 7.3.2 Model Training and Validation
The BERT model was fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of sports-related tweets. The dataset was split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

### 7.3.3 Sentiment Classification
Tweets were classified into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral. The fine-tuned BERT model was applied to the preprocessed tweets to obtain sentiment scores and classifications.

## 7.4 Data Analysis and Visualization

### 7.4.1 Descriptive Statistics
Basic descriptive statistics were calculated for tweet characteristics and sentiment distribution.

### 7.4.2 Temporal Analysis
Sentiment trends were analyzed over time, with particular focus on the periods before, during, and after the Saudi Cup event.

### 7.4.3 Geographical Analysis
Sentiment distribution was mapped across different countries and regions to identify geographical patterns in public opinion.

### 7.4.4 Engagement Analysis
The relationship between sentiment and engagement metrics (retweets, likes) was examined using correlation analysis and visualization techniques.
